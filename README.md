Components used:
Navbar: Navbar navigation links build on our .nav options with their own modifier class and require the use of toggler classes for proper responsive styling. 
Navigation in navbars will also grow to occupy as much horizontal space as possible to keep your navbar contents securely aligned.
Navbars require a wrapping .navbar with .navbar-expand{-sm|-md|-lg|-xl} for responsive collapsing and color scheme classes.
Navbars and their contents are fluid by default. Use optional containers to limit their horizontal width.

Alert: Provide contextual feedback messages for typical user actions with the handful of available and flexible alert messages.
Alerts are available for any length of text, as well as an optional dismiss button.
Alerts can also contain additional HTML elements like headings, paragraphs and dividers.

Carousel: A slideshow component for cycling through elements—images or slides of text—like a carousel.
The carousel is a slideshow for cycling through a series of content, built with CSS 3D transforms and a bit of JavaScript. 
It works with a series of images, text, or custom markup.
 It also includes support for previous/next controls and indicators.

Jumbotron: Lightweight, flexible component for showcasing hero unit style content.
It is a lightweight, flexible component that can optionally extend the entire viewport to showcase key marketing messages on your site.

Cards: A card is a flexible and extensible content container. 
It includes options for headers and footers, a wide variety of content, contextual background colors, and powerful display options. 
Cards replace our old panels, wells, and thumbnails. Similar functionality to those components is available as modifier classes for cards.
Cards are built with as little markup and styles as possible, but still manage to deliver a ton of control and customization. 

Accordion: Build vertically collapsing accordions in combination with our Collapse JavaScript plugin.
The accordion uses collapse internally to make it collapsible. To render an accordion that’s expanded, add the .open class on the .accordion.

Multi Carousel: ootstrap carousel multiple items is an improvised bootstrap carousel which lets you put multiple items within one carousel slide.

Buttons: Buttons are used for various purposes. You can submit or reset an HTML form, perform interactive actions such as showing or hiding something on a web page on click of the button, redirecting the user to another page, etc.

Close Button: Close buttons are used for dismissing modals and alerts.

Dropdown: Dropdowns are toggleable, contextual overlays for displaying lists of links and more. They're made interactive with the included Bootstrap dropdown JavaScript plugin. They're toggled by clicking, not by hovering; this is an intentional design decision.

Badge: Badges are simple and basic components that are used to display an indicator or count a number. This is quite useful for mail count and alerting purposes, among other things.

Footer: A footer is an additional navigation component. It can hold links, buttons, company info, copyrights, forms, and many other elements.

Lists: list component simplifies the creation and customization of organized lists, such as menus and navigation items. It supports both unordered and ordered lists and offers diverse styling options to enhance the visual appeal of the content. With its flexibility and responsive design, Bootstrap's list component is an essential tool for developing streamlined and visually appealing user interfaces.

Table: Table component facilitates the creation of structured data tables, enabling the display of information in a clear and organized format. It offers various features for customization, such as responsive design and styling options, making it an efficient tool for presenting tabular data in web applications.

Progress: Bootstrap Progress Bar component visually represents task progress, offering customization options like colors, styles, and animations, enhancing user experience and communication.
